# Task 1 - Fibonacci Series Generator

## Introduction

This is a simple **Fibonacci Series** generator implemented in C++. The program prompts the user to input how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence they would like to see, and then outputs the sequence accordingly.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It typically starts from 0 and 1.

## How to Start the Program

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler (such as **g++** or **clang**)
- A terminal or command prompt

### Steps to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7xGit/7xGit_Task1.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd [folder_name]
```

3. **Compile the Program**

```bash
g++ fibonacci.cpp -o fibonacci
```

4. **Run the Program**

```bash
./fibonacci
```


## Example Output

```bash
Enter how many Fibonacci numbers to generate: 7
Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```
